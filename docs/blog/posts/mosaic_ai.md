## 🔍 Key Features of Mosaic AI available in Project Fleming

### 🔐 Permission and Rate Limiting

Purpose: Controls who can access model endpoints and how much they can use them.

Functionality: Allows administrators to define access policies and rate limits per user or group, ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse.

Support: Available for most endpoint types, including external models, foundation model APIs (both provisioned and pay-per-token), and custom models. Not supported for Mosaic AI agents.

### 📦 Payload Logging

Purpose: Enables monitoring and auditing of data sent to model APIs by logging requests and responses into inference tables.

Functionality: Captures and stores input/output payloads for each model call, enabling traceability, debugging, and compliance auditing.

Support: Fully supported across all endpoint types, including Mosaic AI agents.

### 📊 Usage Tracking

Purpose: Tracks operational usage and costs of model endpoints using system tables.

Functionality: Aggregates and reports on endpoint activity, including call frequency, latency, and cost metrics, to support budgeting and optimization.

Support: Supported for all endpoint types except Mosaic AI agents.

### ⚖️ Traffic Splitting

Purpose: Load balances traffic across multiple models.

Functionality: Useful for A/B testing or gradual rollouts.

Support: Supported for external, provisioned foundation model APIs, and custom model endpoints.

## 🔍 Further Features of Mosaic AI available with Databricks

### 🔐 AI Guardrails

Purpose: Prevents unsafe or non-compliant data from being processed.

Functionality: Filters out harmful or unwanted content in both requests and responses.

Support: Available for most model endpoints except Mosaic AI agents.

### 🔁 Fallbacks

Purpose: Ensures reliability by minimizing production outages.

Functionality: Automatically switches to backup models or endpoints if the primary fails.

Support: Currently only supported for external model endpoints.
