## 🎯 What’s New?  
- **Multi-endpoint integration** – Users can now connect multiple Databricks endpoints within the UI, bringing varied datasets into one cohesive search experience. 
- **Unified search** – Instead of querying individual endpoints separately, users can now perform searches across all added sources in one go. ⚡  
- **Flexible results navigation** – Results can be explored efficiently, with users able to switch between different tabs to compare data from each endpoint. 

## 🔥 Why This Matters  
This enhancement is a game-changer for workflows that require cross-endpoint searches. Whether performing **bespoke searches across multiple datasets** or **comparing model results during testing**, users can now streamline their work within a single tool. This update eliminates the need for manual aggregation and significantly **improves efficiency in data analysis**. 🚀  

By integrating multi-endpoint functionality into the generic frontend, Project Fleming is empowering users with a **more connected**, **more efficient**, and **more adaptable** search environment.
